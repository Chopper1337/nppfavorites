Favorites plugin for Notepad++

Notepad++ is a GREAT text editor for programmers, but it does not come with favorites... <br>
This project is a simple solution to that problem.

This plugin has been modified by Chopper1337 to increase the max number of favourite files to 13.

Shortcuts do not pass CTRL+ALT+9, files past this will not have a shortcut key.

I have done minimal testing of this modified version :)
